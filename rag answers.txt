The risk of cancer can be reduced by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies [0]. This can prevent between 30 and 50% of cancers [0]. Cancer risk can be reduced by not using tobacco [1], maintaining a healthy body weight [1], eating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables [1], doing physical activity on a regular basis [1], avoiding or reducing consumption of alcohol [1], getting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended [1], avoiding ultraviolet radiation exposure and/or using sun protection measures [1], ensuring safe and appropriate use of radiation in health care [1], minimizing occupational exposure to ionizing radiation [1], and reducing exposure to outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, including radon [1].

Early diagnosis and screening are two components of early detection in cancer, but they have distinct differences. Early diagnosis refers to the process of identifying cancer in its early stages through clinical evaluation and diagnostic services, and timely referral to treatment services [1]. On the other hand, screening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms, and further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow [0].

In other words, early diagnosis focuses on identifying cancer in individuals who are already experiencing symptoms, whereas screening targets asymptomatic individuals to detect cancer at an early stage [0]. This distinction is crucial, as screening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and require special equipment and dedicated personnel [0].
